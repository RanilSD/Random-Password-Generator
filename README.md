# Random-Password-Generator

This random password generator was created through JavaScript with the purpose of creating a strong password with ease; so one can greatly secure their private information.

To use the password generator just go to the webpage, follow the prompts given, and recieve the randomly generated password.

This was made mainly with JavaScript and html. It is not pretty. Just purly functional. If someone would like to go over the css and make it visually appealing or engaging, please do so. Enjoy!
